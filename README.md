##Install & Run WinAppDriver
Download Windows Application Driver installer from https://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver/releases
Run the installer on a Windows 10 machine where your application under test is installed and will be tested
Enable Developer Mode in Windows settings
Run WinAppDriver.exe from the installation directory (E.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Application Driver)
Windows Application Driver will then be running on the test machine listening to requests on the default IP address and port (127.0.0.1:4723).
